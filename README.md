# Libft

## ðŸš€ Libft: My First C Library!
Libft is a curated collection of essential C functions that I developed as part of the 42 SP curriculum. Through this library, I have recreated standard library functions, enhancing my programming skills and establishing a robust foundation in string manipulation, memory management, and more. This journey has allowed me to explore the intricacies of these fundamental functions, paving the way for more advanced projects!

## How to Execute
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/arrudax/libft.git && cd libft_arrudax
```
2. Compile the library:
```sh
make
```
### Functions

| Function | Include   | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `ft_isalpha` | `<ctype.h>` | Checks if a character is **alphabetic** (A-Z, a-z).|
| `ft_isdigit` | `<ctype.h>` | Checks if a character is a **decimal digit** (0-9). |
| `ft_isalnum` | `<ctype.h>` | Checks if a character is **alphanumeric** (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).|
| `ft_isascii` | `<ctype.h>` | Checks if a character belongs to the **ASCII** character set (0-127).|
| `ft_isprint` | `<ctype.h>` | Checks if a character is **printable**, including space.|
| `ft_toupper` | `<ctype.h>` | Converts a lowercase letter to **uppercase** (a to A)|
| `ft_tolower` | `<ctype.h>` | Converts an uppercase letter to **lowercase** (A to a)|
| `ft_memset` | `<string.h>` | Fills a block of memory with a **specified byte value.**|
| `ft_strlen` | `<string.h>` | Returns the **length of a string**, excluding the null terminator ('\0').|
| `ft_strchr` | `<string.h>` | Searches for the first **occurrence** of a character in a string.|
| `ft_strrchr` | `<string.h>` | Searches for the last **occurrence** of a character in a string.|
| `ft_strncmp` | `<string.h>` | Compares up to n characters of two **strings.**|

### Tests

This section emphasizes the significance of testing my library functions to ensure their correctness. By implementing tests, I can validate functionality across a variety of scenarios.

#### Setting Up Criterion for Testing

To use Criterion for testing your library functions, follow these steps:

##### Install Criterion

Since you may not have `sudo` privileges on your 42 partition, you can install Criterion locally by following these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
```sh
   pip install meson ninja
```
2. Clone the Criterion Repository: Clone the Criterion repository to your home directory and navigate into the Criterion folder:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion.git && cd Criterion
```
3. Set Up the Build Directory: Create a build directory:
```sh
mkdir build
```
4. Configure the Build with Meson: Run the Meson setup command:
```sh
meson setup build
```
5. Compile with Ninja: Use Ninja to compile:
```sh
ninja -C build
```
6. Install Criterion: Install the Criterion library:
```sh
ninja -C build install
```
7. Edit Your Shell Configuration: Open your .bashrc or .zshrc file and add the following lines:
```.bashrc | .zshrc
export C_INCLUDE_PATH="$HOME/.local/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LIBRARY_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
8. Load the Environment Variables: Reload your shell configuration:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc  # or `source ~/.zshrc` if you're using zsh
```
9. Compile the Tests: Finally, compile the tests with the command:
```sh
make test
```
